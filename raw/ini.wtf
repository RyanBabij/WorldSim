Notes:
SAVE_FOLDER_PATH should be alphanumeric... It is not checked for safety atm. Avoid leading slashes, ideally it
should be a folder name alone, or an absolute path if you need it somewhere specifically. Folder should be automatically
created. Beware that it may clear the given folder on closing, therefore don't mix it with other data.
